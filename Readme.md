PromptMaster Pro 🚀
Your Smart Toolkit for Perfecting AI Prompts

PromptMaster Pro is a user-friendly app designed to help anyone write, test, and improve the instructions (prompts) you give to AI models. Think of it as a playground and a lab for getting the best possible results from artificial intelligence.

Whether you're a writer, a developer, a student, or just curious, this tool helps you communicate with AI more effectively.

What Can You Do with PromptMaster Pro?
This tool makes advanced AI techniques simple and accessible. Here are the core features:

1. 🧠 Write Better Prompts
Don't just ask a question; guide the AI to the perfect answer.

Simple Instructions: Just type a command and see what you get.

Learn by Example: Give the AI a few examples of what you want, and it will follow your pattern.

Step-by-Step Thinking: Ask the AI to "think step-by-step" to solve complex problems, leading to more accurate results.

2. 📐 Get Organized Answers
Tired of getting a wall of text? Tell the AI exactly how you want your answer formatted.

Ask for a JSON file for your app.

Request a Markdown table for your report.

Get a simple bulleted list of action items.
The system checks if the AI followed your rules and helps you fix the prompt if it didn't.

3. 🔧 Make the AI Do Real Things (Function Calling)
Allow the AI to go beyond just talking. You can let it trigger real-world actions.

Ask, "What's the weather in Hoshiarpur?" and the AI can use a getWeather() function to fetch live data.

Tell it, "Find the stock price for GOOGL," and it can look it up.

This turns your AI into a true assistant that can interact with other services.

4. 📚 Teach the AI with Your Data (RAG)
Ground the AI's answers in facts, not just its general knowledge.

Upload a PDF, a document, or a website link.

Ask a question about the content in that document.

The AI will use your provided information to form its answer, making it highly accurate and specific to your needs. This is perfect for analyzing reports, summarizing research papers, or creating a customer support bot.

Key Features at a Glance
Prompt Analyzer: Get suggestions to improve your prompts.

Formatted Output: Ensure answers are in a clean, usable format (like JSON or tables).

Real-World Actions: Connect the AI to live data and tools.

Use Your Own Docs: "Teach" the AI using your own files for fact-based answers.

History & Versions: Save and compare different versions of your prompts to see what works best.

Cost Tracker: See how much each AI query costs.

Future Plans
A library of pre-built prompt templates for different jobs.

Community features to share and rate prompts.
