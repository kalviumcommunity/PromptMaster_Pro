## 🔹 What is Zero-Shot Prompting?

**Zero-shot prompting** means giving an AI model (like GPT) a **task without providing any examples** beforehand.  
You only describe what you want in natural language, and the model uses its pretraining knowledge to respond correctly.  

👉 In short: **“Do this task, even though I haven’t shown you any examples.”**

## 🔹 Why "Zero-Shot"?

The name comes from ML terminology:

- **Few-shot learning** → Provide a few examples before asking the model to generalize.  
- **Zero-shot learning** → No examples, just instructions.
